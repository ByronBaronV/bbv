# Local Music Event Finder

## Project Description
Description: A web-based app that helps users discover live music events happening near them.
Problem Solved: Many people miss out on local music events due to lack of information or proper event discovery tools.
Key Features: Event search based on location or artist (Geolocation services to find nearby events).
Out of Scope:
No direct ticket purchases through the app.
It wonâ€™t track live stream events (only physical concerts).
