# Status Update Report
## Project Title: [Montreal Local Artists Music]
## Student Name: [Byron Baron] Status: Dec. 7th, 2024.

The project already has:
1. A Flask web application (main.py) that handles routing and file uploads.
2. A database setup (database.py) for storing custom sounds.
3. HTML templates for the keyboard interface and custom sounds management.
4. CSS styling for the user interface.
5. JavaScript code for keyboard functionality, including:
  - Sound generation using Tone.js
  - Effects processing (reverb, delay, distortion)
  - Instrument switching
  - Custom sound loading
6. A SQL schema for the database structure.

Current Needs:
1. Error handling and user feedback in the Flask application.
2. Testing of the file upload functionality.
3. Implementation of custom sound playback in the JavaScript code.
4. Documentation for setup and usage.
5. Comments in the code to explain functionality for presentation purposes.

Next steps:
1. Complete the Flask application:
  - Add error handling for file uploads and database operations.
  - Implement flash messages for user feedback.
  - Test the file upload functionality thoroughly.
2. Finalize the JavaScript implementation:
  - Complete the custom sound playback feature.
  - Add comments to explain the Tone.js setup and effects processing.
  - Test all keyboard functionalities (key presses, instrument switching, effects).
3. Database integration:
  - Ensure the database is properly initialized on application start.
  - Test the storage and retrieval of custom sounds.
4. User Interface refinement:
  - Add labels and instructions for the effects controls.
  - Implement responsive design for mobile devices.
5. Documentation:
  - Create a README.md file explaining the project setup and how to run it.
  - Document the technologies used (Flask, SQLite, Tone.js) and their purposes.
